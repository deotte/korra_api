# Legend of Korra API

Rest API inspired by the Legend of Korra show

## Technologies Used

## Hitting the API

## Local Development

[Local Development Guide](https://github.com/deotte/korra_api/wiki/Local-Development)

If you pull down the project and want to work on it on your own machine, it can be a little tricky if you've never used Firebase.

You'll first need to create your own [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) with a Firestore database to connect to. If you've never done this, I wrote a [step by step guide](https://medium.com/@derrickotte/creating-your-first-firebase-project-a-step-by-step-guide-4198a97cef9a) a while back that you can follow!

## Special Thanks

Thanks to the folks who worked on the [Last Airbender API](https://github.com/paigeegorry/last-airbender-api) for the inspiration!
